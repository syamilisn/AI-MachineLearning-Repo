#1.Import Data

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

        iris.data, iris.target, test_size = .25)

#3.Build The Model
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
clf = KNeighborsClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

#4.Calculate Accuracy of the Test  data with the trained data
print(" Accuracy=",clf.score(X_test, y_test))


#5 Calculate the prediction with the labels of the test data 
print("Predicted Data")
print(clf.predict(X_test))

#6 To identify the miss classification
diff=prediction-y_test
print("Result is ")
print(diff)
